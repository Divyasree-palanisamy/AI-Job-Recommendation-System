GET YOUR GMAIL APP PASSWORD FOR EMAIL SENDING
===============================================

You have Gmail configured but need an App Password to send emails.

PROBLEM:
- Gmail requires App Password (not regular password) for SMTP
- Your current password is not an App Password

SOLUTION:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification (if not already enabled)
3. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Sign in if prompted
5. Select "Mail" from the dropdown
6. Select "Other (custom name)" from the device dropdown
7. Enter "Career Portal" as the custom name
8. Click "Generate"
9. COPY the 16-character password that appears
   Example: abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop

UPDATE YOUR CONFIGURATION:
1. Open your .env file
2. Replace the MAIL_PASSWORD line with your 16-character App Password:
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password

EXAMPLE .env FILE:
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=divyasreep12@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=noreply@careerguidance.com

TEST IT:
1. Save the .env file
2. Restart your app: python app.py
3. Go to login page
4. Click "Forgot Password?"
5. Enter an email address
6. Check your Gmail inbox - you should receive the password reset email!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Make sure you copy the App Password exactly (16 characters)
- Check your spam/junk folder for the email
- Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Gmail account
- App Passwords are specific to each application
