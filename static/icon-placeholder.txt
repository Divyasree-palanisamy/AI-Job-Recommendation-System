# PWA Icon Files Needed

For the PWA to work properly, you need to create these icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels) - For Android and general use
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels) - For high-resolution displays
3. screenshot-mobile.png (390x844 pixels) - Mobile screenshot for app stores

You can create these using:
- Canva.com (free)
- Figma.com (free tier)
- Photoshop
- Any image editor

Design suggestions:
- Use your app's primary color (#2563eb - blue)
- Include career/job related icons
- Make it look professional and modern
- Use PNG format with transparency

Once created, replace the placeholder files with actual PNG images.
