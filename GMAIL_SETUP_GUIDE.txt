GMAIL SETUP GUIDE FOR PASSWORD RESET EMAILS
=============================================

This guide will help you configure Gmail to send password reset emails from your Career Portal.

STEP 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
-------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Sign in to your Gmail account
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
4. Click "Get Started"
5. Follow the steps to enable 2FA (phone verification, etc.)
6. Once enabled, you'll see "2-Step Verification is ON"

STEP 2: Generate Gmail App Password
-----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in if prompted
3. Under "Select app", choose "Mail"
4. Under "Select device", choose "Other (custom name)"
5. Enter "Career Portal" as the custom name
6. Click "Generate"
7. COPY the 16-character password that appears
8. Save this password - you'll need it!

STEP 3: Configure Your App
--------------------------
1. In your project folder, rename "configure_email_env.txt" to ".env"
2. Open the .env file and replace these values:

   MAIL_USERNAME=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password

   Example:
   MAIL_USERNAME=johnsmith@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop

STEP 4: Test Configuration
-------------------------
1. Run: python test_email.py
2. You should see: "Email configuration looks good!"
3. If you see errors, double-check your credentials

STEP 5: Restart Your App
-----------------------
1. Stop your Flask app (Ctrl+C if running)
2. Restart: python app.py
3. Test password reset functionality

STEP 6: Test Password Reset
--------------------------
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5007/login
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Check your Gmail inbox (and spam folder)
5. You should receive a professional password reset email!

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

ERROR: "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- Verify 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
- Check that you copied the App Password correctly (no spaces)

ERROR: "Daily sending limit exceeded"
- Gmail allows 500 emails/day for free accounts
- For more emails, consider upgrading to Google Workspace or use a service like SendGrid

ERROR: "Emails going to spam"
- Add the sender email to your Gmail contacts
- Check your spam/junk folder
- The emails are signed properly and should not go to spam

TESTING WITHOUT REAL EMAILS
===========================

If you want to test the functionality without sending real emails, you can temporarily modify the send_password_reset_email function in app.py to print the email content instead of sending it.

Just add this line at the top of the function:
print(f"EMAIL WOULD BE SENT TO: {email}")
print(f"RESET LINK: {reset_url}")
return True  # Return True to simulate success

This will show you what the email would contain without actually sending it.

SECURITY NOTES
==============

- Never share your App Password with anyone
- App Passwords are specific to each application
- You can revoke App Passwords anytime from your Google Account settings
- Regular password changes don't affect App Passwords

PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
========================

For a production deployment:
1. Use a professional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES)
2. Set up proper SPF/DKIM records
3. Use environment variables securely
4. Monitor email delivery rates
5. Have a backup email system

The current Gmail setup is perfect for development and small-scale use!
